The "Holography" directory is dedicated to projects and resources related to holographic displays, creating a space where developers and researchers can collaborate on advancing holographic technologies.

Display Projects: In the "Display Projects" subfolder, contributors can store code, documentation and design files for various holographic display projects. This includes prototypes, holographic rendering algorithms and interactive display experiments. Each project should have a clear structure with documentation outlining the goals, methodologies and implementation details.

Research Papers: The "Research Papers" subfolder is an archive for storing research papers, articles and studies relevant to advancements in holography. It serves as a knowledge repository, providing contributors with a reference point for the latest developments, challengers and breakthroughs in the field. Summaries or annotations can accompany each paper to aid comprehension.
