The "Documentation" directory is essential for providing clear guidelines, instructions and educational content for both developers and designers contributing to holography and AR projects.

Project Guides: The "Project Guides" subfolder contains guides and instructions tailored for developers. This includes setup instructions for holographic display projects, coding guidelines and best practices to ensure a consistent and high-quality development process across various holography and AR projects.

Design Docs: The "Design Docs" subfolder is dedicated to documenting design principles, user experience considerations and guidelines for AR projects. Clear design documentation ensures that AR interfaces are visually coherent, user-driently and aligned with the intended user experience.
